# Learning Python

This repository has been created to store and reference my python notes and scripts while learning the language across multiple workstations.

The following is a list of reference materials that I am using in order to become fluent in Python:

1. Stack Skills (Become a Professional Python Programmer): https://stackskills.com/courses/35857
2. Learn Python The Hard Way: https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/
3. Primal Security Python Tutorials: http://www.primalsecurity.net/tutorials/python-tutorials/
4. Violent Python [Book]
5. Black Hat Python [Book]
6. Automate the Boring Stuff with Python [Book]

My goal is to work through these materials linearly until I have completed all of the exercises and covered all of the relevant topics within.
